## Astro v3.0 Breaking Changes

Astro v3.0 includes some breaking changes, as well as the removal of some previously deprecated features. If your project doesn't work as expected after upgrading to v3.0, check this guide for an overview of all breaking changes and instructions on how to update your codebase.

See [the changelog](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/astro/CHANGELOG.md) for full release notes.

### Removed: Support for Node 16

Node 16 is scheduled to reach its End of Life in September 2023. 

Astro v3.0 drops Node 16 support entirely, so that all Astro users can take advantage of Node's more modern features.

#### What should I do?

 Check that both your development environment and your deployment environment are using **Node `18.14.1` or later**.

1. Check your local version of Node using:

    ```sh
    node -v
    ```

    If your local development environment needs upgrading, [install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).


2. Check your [deployment environment's](/en/guides/deploy/) own documentation to verify that they support Node 18. 

    You can specify Node `18.14.1` for your Astro project either in a dashboard configuration setting, or a `.nvmrc` file.
